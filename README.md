# Dice or Die
Welcome to the "Dice or Die" dice game manual!

Objective:
---
The objective of the game is to achieve the highest score possible while avoiding the lowest score.

In each round, the player with the lowest score loses a life.

The player who loses all three lives is the loser.

Game Setup:
---
Each player starts with 3 lives.

The first player for the first round is determined randomly.

The first player has up to three rolls to obtain the best possible score but can choose to stop at any time, and the other players will have to play with the number of rolls used by the first player.

How to Play:
---
In each round, players roll 5 dice.

After the roll, the player can choose to keep some of the dice and reroll the remaining ones or reroll all the dice.

After, the player decides to stop or has used all their rolls, their score for that round is recorded.

The score is determined by the number of dice grouped with the same value.

Face 1 of the dice is a wild card and can take any desired value by each player. (Except for making a straight)

If multiple players have the same number of grouped dice, the one with the highest value among those dice gets the highest score.

If a player gets a straight, they obtain the highest score.

In case of a tie, the last player to make the move loses.

The player with the lowest score loses a life.

Important Notes:
---
If a player gets a straight (2, 3, 4, 5, 6), they get the highest possible score.

To get a straight, it is NOT possible to use any wild cards.

The player who lost the previous round starts the next one.

If two or more players get the same score, the player who achieved that score last loses.

A player who loses a round loses a life. If a player loses all their lives, the game ends, and the loser faces the punishment.

Example 1:
---
Player 1 rolls: 1, 2, 2, 5, 6 -> Final play: 2(1), 2, 2

Player 2 rolls: 1, 1, 1, 4, 5 -> Final play: 5(1), 5(1), 5(1), 5

Player 3 rolls: 2, 2, 2, 4, 4 -> Final play: 2, 2, 2

Player 4 rolls: 1, 1, 3, 4, 4 -> Final play: 4(1), 4(1), 4, 4

The loser is Player 3, as although they have the same score as Player 1, they were the last to play.

In this case, the best play would be Player 2's, as they grouped 5 dice, and the value of their dice is higher than Player 4's.

Example 2:
---
Player 1 rolls: 1, 2, 2, 2, 6 -> Final play: 2(1), 2, 2, 2

Player 2 rolls: 2, 2, 3, 6, 6 -> Final play: 6, 6

Player 3 rolls: 2, 2, 2, 6, 6 -> Final play: 2, 2, 2

Player 4 rolls: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 -> Final play: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

The loser is Player 2, as they only managed to group 2 dice with the same value.

The best play would be Player 4's straight.
